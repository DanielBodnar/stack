Only certain `tsconfig` fields are supported by ESBuild:
- baseUrl
- extends
- importsNotUsedAsValues
- jsxFactory
- jsxFragmentFactory
- paths
- useDefineForClassFields
Source: https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#tsconfig-json

For the `target`/`module`... a mapping is necessary

/*
ESBuild is not intented to make type checking or generate declaration typing file.
For these use cases:
- Declaration: tsc with emitDeclarationOnly (no typing bundle)
- Declaration: https://github.com/timocov/dts-bundle-generator (to bundle typing)
- Check: tsc with noEmit (not needed in watch mode: will only slow down watching process + IDE highlighting is sufficient. Could be used during build and in typing check during pre-commit hook)
